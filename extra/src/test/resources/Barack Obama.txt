Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.<ref name="health reform" /> He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&nbsp;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[public health insurance option|public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American to carry health coverage.

====Energy policy====
{{main|Energy policy of the Obama administration}}
Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based "All of the above" approach to domestic energy policy which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.<ref>Rebecca Droke, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 17, 2014, "Obama speaks in Pittsburgh about tech, jobs."</ref> Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of nation's available energy resources.<ref>Obama domestic energy policy.

===Religious views===
[[File:Obamas at church on Inauguration Day 2013.jpg|thumb|Obama and First Lady worship at [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in Washington, D.C., January 2013]]
Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.<ref name="Christian" /> He wrote in ''The Audacity of Hope'' that he "was not raised in a religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as "non-practicing [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptists]]"), as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known." He described his father as a "confirmed [[atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."<ref name="social change" />

In January 2008, Obama told ''[[Christianity Today]]'': "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]]. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pulliam |first1=Sarah |last2=Olsen |first2=Ted |url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/104-32.0.html?start=2 |title=Q&A: Barack Obama |work=Christianity Today |location=Carol Stream, IL |date=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me."<ref name="APbychoice">{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/28/obama-christian-by-choice_n_742124.html?view=print |title= Obama 'Christian By Choice': President Responds To Questioner |author= Babington, Charles; Superville, Darlene |agency=Associated Press |date=September 28, 2010 |work=The Huffington Post}}</ref><ref name="ABCVideobychoice">Video&nbsp;– [http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/09/president-obama-i-am-a-christian-by-choicethe-precepts-of-jesus-spoke-to-me.html "President Obama: 'I am a Christian By Choice'"].

Obama met [[Trinity United Church of Christ]] pastor Rev.

After a prolonged effort to find a church to attend regularly in Washington, Obama announced in June 2009 that his primary place of worship would be the Evergreen Chapel at [[Camp David]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Amy |date=June 29, 2009 |title=The Obamas find a church home—away from home |work=Time |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1908437,00.html |accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref>
