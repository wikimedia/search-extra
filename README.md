Extra Queries and Filters [![Build Status](https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/buildStatus/icon?job=search-extra)](https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/job/search-extra)
=========================

The plan is for this to include any extra queries, filters, native scripts,
score functions, and anything else we think we end up creating to make search
nice for Wikimedia. At this point it only contains:

Queries:
* [source_regex](docs/source_regex.md) - An nGram accelerated regular
expression filter that is generally much much faster than sequentially checking
all documents.
* [token_count_router](docs/token_count_router.md) - Simple query wrapper that
evaluates some conditions based on the number of tokens of the input query.

Native Scripts:
* [super_detect_noop](docs/super_detect_noop.md) - Like ```detect_noop``` but
supports configurable sloppiness. New in 1.5.0, 1.4.1, and 1.3.1.

Analysis:
* [preserve_original](docs/preserve_original.md) - A token filter that wraps a
filter chain to keep and emit the original term at the same position. New in
2.3.4.
